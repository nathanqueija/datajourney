# Data journey

In this repo, you'll find the outcomes of what I've been learning about Data Science & Machine Learning for the past two years.

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to practice and organize my learning so I can always have a place to come back and remember the content, but also to help people that are on the same learning journey.

Feel free to open a Pull Request if you want to contribute.
