Let's say that this school wants to run an experiment to find anomalies in the student's grades, for example, to find students that for some reason stopped performing consistently. Maybe considering the outliers would be beneficial to reach the conclusions in this case.\n",

    "To sum up, don't add or remove outliers (or use the mean or median) without thinking about what is your goal. Understand your data. Your data has different ways to tell you stories, it's up to you to understand which story is more important to you in a given situation.\n",
