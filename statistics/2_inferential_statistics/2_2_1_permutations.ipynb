Counting simple problems is easier, but as complexity starts to grow it's not feasible to do the counting by hand.\n",

    "Permutations in probability refer to sequences of outcomes where the order matters. It's the number of ways we can arrange things. How many possibilities are there that I can arrange a set of things? Here order matters. For example, 1-2-3-4 is a permutation of a four-digit PIN and the order matters. 1-2-3-4 is different from 1-4-2-3. When calculating probabilities, it’s frequently necessary to calculate the number of possible permutations to determine an event’s probability.\n",
